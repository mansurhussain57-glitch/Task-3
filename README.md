Networking basics are fundamental to cybersecurity because they explain how data moves between devices and systems, which is essential for identifying and preventing attacks. Key concepts include network types (LAN, WAN), devices like routers, switches, and firewalls, and protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and FTP that govern data communication. Understanding IP addressing, subnets, ports, and MAC addresses helps security professionals track traffic and detect suspicious activity. Cybersecurity relies heavily on knowledge of network models like OSI and TCP/IP to analyze vulnerabilities at different layers. Network security also involves monitoring traffic, implementing access controls, encrypting data, and defending against threats such as malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Overall, strong networking knowledge enables effective protection, detection, and response to cyber threats.
